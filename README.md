#**Stick and Burn Trailer Website**
### by Bijan Marashi (bm6410@att.com)

This project is my attempt at completing the Movie Trailer Website project.


###**Installation**

Just clone the repo to your local.  

###**Usage**


To launch the app, run the entertainment_center.py file in any python shell.  

The app displays a number of my favorite films from which I take (guilty) pleasure. 

Clicking on one of the posters will launch a window to show you the trailer for the movie.

###**Sources**

The bulk of the code is taken from the tutorials in Udacity.  I have changed the styling somewhat, and added my own films.

##**HAVE FUN!**
